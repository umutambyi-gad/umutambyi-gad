#### About me
I'm Humble, Curious, Passionate, Empathetic jonior Software Developer from Rwanda

I've been programming since I was a little kid on behalf of courage of my senior Software Engineer uncle and really loved it. I joined Software Development in high school, bootcamps and many online courses to elevate my skills.
I'm also both open source and technology enthusiastic and other relevant to programming.
